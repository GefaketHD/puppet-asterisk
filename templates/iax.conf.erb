; You can adjust several parameters relating to the jitter buffer.
; The jitter buffer's function is to compensate for varying
; network delay.
;
; There are presently two jitterbuffer implementations available for Asterisk
; and chan_iax2; the classic and the new, channel/application independent
; implementation.  These are controlled at compile-time.  The new jitterbuffer
; additionally has support for PLC which greatly improves quality as the
; jitterbuffer adapts size, and in compensating for lost packets.
;
; All the jitter buffer settings except dropcount are in milliseconds.
; The jitter buffer works for INCOMING audio - the outbound audio
; will be dejittered by the jitter buffer at the other end.
;
; jitterbuffer=yes|no: global default as to whether you want
; the jitter buffer at all.
;
; forcejitterbuffer=yes|no: in the ideal world, when we bridge VoIP channels
; we don't want to do jitterbuffering on the switch, since the endpoints
; can each handle this.  However, some endpoints may have poor jitterbuffers 
; themselves, so this option will force * to always jitterbuffer, even in this
; case.
; [This option presently applies only to the new jitterbuffer implementation]
;
; dropcount: the jitter buffer is sized such that no more than "dropcount"
; frames would have been "too late" over the last 2 seconds.
; Set to a small number.  "3" represents 1.5% of frames dropped
; [This option is not applicable to, and ignored by the new jitterbuffer implementation]
;
; maxjitterbuffer: a maximum size for the jitter buffer.
; Setting a reasonable maximum here will prevent the call delay
; from rising to silly values in extreme situations; you'll hear
; SOMETHING, even though it will be jittery.
;
; resyncthreshold: when the jitterbuffer notices a significant change in delay
; that continues over a few frames, it will resync, assuming that the change in
; delay was caused by a timestamping mix-up. The threshold for noticing a
; change in delay is measured as twice the measured jitter plus this resync
; threshold.
; Resyncing can be disabled by setting this parameter to -1.
; [This option presently applies only to the new jitterbuffer implementation]
;
; maxjitterinterps: the maximum number of interpolation frames the jitterbuffer
; should return in a row. Since some clients do not send CNG/DTX frames to
; indicate silence, the jitterbuffer will assume silence has begun after
; returning this many interpolations. This prevents interpolating throughout
; a long silence.
; [This option presently applies only to the new jitterbuffer implementation]
;
; maxexcessbuffer: If conditions improve after a period of high jitter,
; the jitter buffer can end up bigger than necessary.  If it ends up
; more than "maxexcessbuffer" bigger than needed, Asterisk will start
; gradually decreasing the amount of jitter buffering.
; [This option is not applicable to, and ignored by the new jitterbuffer implementation]
;
; minexcessbuffer: Sets a desired mimimum amount of headroom in 
; the jitter buffer.  If Asterisk has less headroom than this, then
; it will start gradually increasing the amount of jitter buffering.
; [This option is not applicable to, and ignored by the new jitterbuffer implementation]
;
; jittershrinkrate: when the jitter buffer is being gradually shrunk 
; (or enlarged), how many millisecs shall we take off per 20ms frame
; received?  Use a small number, or you will be able to hear it
; changing.  An example: if you set this to 2, then the jitter buffer
; size will change by 100 millisecs per second.
; [This option is not applicable to, and ignored by the new jitterbuffer implementation]

; ((8000hz / 1000ms) * 20ms * 1 byte per sample = 160 bytes per frame), the maximum load
; in bytes is (160 bytes per frame) * (800 calls) = 128000 bytes total. Once this limit is

; number of channels to be supported this value may need to be raised, but in most cases the

; which means if a trunk's payload is over 1240 bytes for every 20ms it will be broken into

; well.  Note, depending on the size set by trunkmtu, messages may be sent more often than
